# **Modern Python** üêç

## Like Regular Python, But Better

---
## **What's wrong with how I write Python now?**

Nothing (necessarily)

---

## **New isn't always better**

* Just because I like it doesn't mean you have to
* Take what you like, and leave what you don't

## ‚ú® **Type hints** ‚ú®

From this:

```python
def shout(word):
    print(f"{str.upper(word)}!")
```

To this:

```python
def shout(word: str) -> None:
    print(f"{str.upper(word)}!")
```

---

>Type hints help us **document our code more easily** and **catch errors early**.

## **But isn't Python dynamically typed?** ü§î

‚ö†Ô∏è Type hints are **aesthetic**, they don't actually enforce anything in our code. ‚ö†Ô∏è

## **Type aliases**

```python
Point = tuple[float, float]

def scale(point: Point, factor: float) -> Point:
    return (factor * point[0], factor * point[1])


UserId = str

def delete_users(users: list[UserId]) -> None:
    for user in users:
        # Some logic here
```

---

## **Built-ins vs. `from typing import ...`**

```python
from typing Dict, List, Tuple

foo = List[int]
bar = list[int]

baz = Tuple[float, float]
qux = tuple[float, float]

spam = Dict[str, str]
ham = dict[str, str]
```

Built-ins are preferred (e.g., `list`, `dict`).

___

## **We can type-hint functions too**

```python
from typing import Any, Callable, Sequence

def apply(func: Callable[[Any], Any], values: Sequence[Any]) -> list[Any]:
    return [func(value) for value in values]

values = (1, 2, 3)
double = lambda x: 2 * x
applied_values = apply(double, values) # [2, 4, 6]
```

---

## **Typed generics**

```python
from typing import Callable, Sequence, TypeVar

T = TypeVar("T")
U = TypeVar("U")

def apply(func: Callable[[T], U], values: Sequence[T]) -> list[U]:
    return [func(value) for value in values]
```

---

## **What exactly is a `Sequence`?**

* Abstract base class (ABC) that implements `__getitem__` and `__len__`

* Classes like `list` and `tuple` are "virtual" subclasses of `Sequence`

* When we use `for` in a loop or comprehension, we call `iter()` which looks for `__iter__` or `__getitem__`

```python
from typing import Sequence

issubclass(list, Sequence) # True
issubclass(tuple, Sequence) # True
issubclass(str, Sequence) # True
```

---

## **General in ‚Üí specific out**

> If functions or methods only need their inputs to have very specific behaviours (e.g., the ability to be sequenced or iterated over), then consider using ABCs in type annotations to maintain flexibility.

<br/>

ABCs like `Sequence`, `Mapping`, `Iterable`, `Iterator` etc. are all just conceptual containers that implement certain magic (dunder) methods.

---

## **What if I want to sub-type *my own* classes?**

```python
from typing import Generic, TypeVar


T = TypeVar("T")

class MagicList(Generic[T]):
    def __init__(self, *args: T) -> None:
        ...


magic_list: MagicList[int] = MagicList(1, 2, 3)
```

## **Nominal vs. structural subtyping**

---

* Typed generics
* Structual vs. nominal sub-typing
* Protocols vs abc.ABC
* Talk about Mypy and linters
* How does Any work
