# **Modern Python** üêç

## Like Regular Python, But Better

---
## **What's wrong with how I write Python now?**

Nothing...necessarily üëÄ

---

## **New isn't always better**

* Just because I like it doesn't mean you have to
* Take what you like, and leave what you don't

___

## ‚ú® **Type hints** ‚ú®

From this:

```python
def shout(word):
    print(f"{str.upper(word)}!")
```

To this:

```python
def shout(word: str) -> None:
    print(f"{str.upper(word)}!")
```

---

>Type hints help us **document our code more easily** and **catch errors early**.

---

## **But isn't Python dynamically typed?** ü§î

Type hints are **aesthetic**, they don't actually enforce anything in our code.

</br></br></br></br>
<p style="font-size: 0.8em">(we'll see later how we can get closer to something that looks like static typing üòç)</p>

---

## **Type aliases**

```python
Point = tuple[float, float]

def scale(point: Point, factor: float) -> Point:
    return (factor * point[0], factor * point[1])


UserId = str

def delete_users(users: list[UserId]) -> None:
    for user in users:
        # Some logic here
```

---

## **Built-ins vs. `typing`**

```python
from typing Dict, List, Tuple

foo = List[int]
bar = list[int]

baz = Tuple[float, float]
qux = tuple[float, float]

spam = Dict[str, str]
ham = dict[str, str]
```

Built-ins are preferred (e.g., `list`, `dict`).

___

## **Generic types**

---

* Show how to type hint functions with `Callable`
* Show how typed generics work
* Talk about Mypy and linters
