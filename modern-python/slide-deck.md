# **Modern Python** üêç

## Like Regular Python, But Better

---
## **What's wrong with how I write Python now?**

Nothing (necessarily)

---

## **New isn't always better**

* Just because I like it doesn't mean you have to
* Take what you like, and leave what you don't

---

## **Structural pattern matching**

* Python's (less useful), version of Scala pattern matching.
* Similar to `if` statements.
* Used for checking the _structure_ of an object, not just its value

---

We can avoid code like `if isinctance(animal, Dog)` using the much nicer `match` syntax:

```python
match animal:
    case Dog():
        print("woof!")
    case Cat():
        print("meow!")
    case Bird():
        print("tweet!")
    case _:
        print("Wait, there are more than three animals?!")
```

---

We destructure objects if we're only interested in specific aspects of their structure:

```python
match point:
    case (0, _):
        print("Has no x-component")
    case (_, 0):
        print("Has no y-component")
    case (x, y):
        print(f"x={x}, y={y}")
    case _:
        print("Not a point")


match order:
    case {"order_type": "order_placed", **rest}:
        print(f"Order placed")
    case {"order_type": "order_cancelled", **rest}:
        print("Order cancelled")
    case _:
        print("Something else")
```

---

* Most useful when matching some aspect of the overall object structure
* If matching against literals, it's usually easier to just use the more familiar if/else.

---

## ‚ú® **Type hints** ‚ú®

From this:

```python
def shout(word):
    print(f"{str.upper(word)}!")
```

To this:

```python
def shout(word: str) -> None:
    print(f"{str.upper(word)}!")
```

---

>Type hints help us **document our code more easily** and **catch errors early**.

---

## **But isn't Python dynamically typed?** ü§î

‚ö†Ô∏è Type hints are **aesthetic**, they don't actually enforce anything in our code. ‚ö†Ô∏è

<br/>

---

## **Type aliases**

```python
Point = tuple[float, float]

def scale(point: Point, factor: float) -> Point:
    return (factor * point[0], factor * point[1])


UserId = str

def delete_users(users: list[UserId]) -> None:
    for user in users:
        # Some logic here
```

---

## **Built-ins vs. `from typing import ...`**

```python
from typing Dict, List, Tuple


foo = List[int]
bar = list[int]

baz = Tuple[float, float]
qux = tuple[float, float]

spam = Dict[str, str]
ham = dict[str, str]
```

Built-ins are preferred (e.g., `list`, `dict`).

___

## **We can type-hint functions too**

```python
from typing import Any, Callable, Sequence


def apply(func: Callable[[Any], Any], values: Sequence[Any]) -> list[Any]:
    return [func(value) for value in values]

values = (1, 2, 3)
double = lambda x: 2 * x
applied_values = apply(double, values) # [2, 4, 6]
```

---

## **Avoid `Any` wherever you can**

* When we use `Any`, we're basically adding a type hint for the sake of it
* Objects annotated with `Any` **do not** get type checked
* We can leave `Any` out and it will be inferred by a type checker

```python
from typing import Callable, Sequence


def apply(func: Callable, values: Sequence) -> list:
    return [func(value) for value in values]
```

---

## **What exactly is a `Sequence`?**

* Originates in `collections.abc`

* An interface that defines `__getitem__` and `__len__` abstract methods

* Classes like `list`, `tuple` and `str` are *"virtual subclasses"* of `Sequence`

```python
from typing import Sequence


issubclass(list, Sequence) # True
issubclass(tuple, Sequence) # True
issubclass(str, Sequence) # True
```

---

## **Typed generics**

```python
from typing import Callable, Sequence, TypeVar


T = TypeVar("T")
U = TypeVar("U")


def apply(func: Callable[[T], U], values: Sequence[T]) -> list[U]:
    return [func(value) for value in values]


def first(values: Sequence[T]) -> T | None:
    return values[0] if len(values) != 0 else None
```

---

## **General in ‚Üí specific out**

> If functions or methods only need their inputs to have generic behaviours (e.g., the ability to be sequenced or iterated over), then consider using ABCs in type annotations to maintain flexibility.

<br/>

ABCs like `Sequence`, `Mapping`, `Iterable` and `Iterator` are all just interfaces with abstract methods for us to override (usually dunder methods like `__get__` or `__next__`).

---

## **What if I want to subtype *my own* classes?**

```python
from typing import Generic, TypeVar


T = TypeVar("T")

class MagicList(Generic[T]):
    def __init__(self, *args: T) -> None:
        ...


magic_list: MagicList[int] = MagicList(1, 2, 3)
```

---

## **Nominal vs. structural typing**

Nominal ‚Üí compatibility determined from declared type - ***"is it?"***
Structural ‚Üí compatibility determined from structure - ***"does it?"***

---

## **Interfaces - ABCs or Protocols?**

* Languages like Java make a distinction between *interfaces* and *abstract classes*
* In Python, we talk about interfaces and abstract classes interchangeably
* When we talk about an interface, we're really just thinking of a *blueprint*
* We can define an interface using either `abc.ABC` or `typing.Protocol`

---

## **Using `abc.ABC` fits a nominal typing style**

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod


class Sizeable(ABC):

    @abstractmethod
    def size(self) -> int:
        ...
```

---

To use an ABC, we have to explicitly inherit from the parent class.

```python
def is_empty(container: Sizeable) -> bool:
    return container.size() == 0


class Trolley(Sizeable):
    def __init__(self, items: list[str]) -> None:
        self.items = items

    def size(self) -> int:
        return len(self.items)

    def add_item(item: str) -> None:
        self.items = [*self.items, item]


trolley = Trolley(["Bread", "Milk", "Eggs"])
print(is_empty(trolley)) # False

```

---

## **Using `typing.Protocol` fits a structrual style**

Protocols let us make use of static duck-typing and help us to define generic type bounds.

```python
from typing import Protocol


class Sizeable(Protocol):

    def size(self) -> int:
        ...
```

---

```python
def is_empty(container: Sizeable) -> bool:
    return container.size() == 0


class Trolley:  # No need to inherit from Sizeable
    def __init__(self, items: list[str]) -> None:
        self.items = items

    def size(self) -> int:
        return len(self.items)

    def add_item(item: str) -> None:
        self.items = [*self.items, item]


trolley = Trolley(["Bread", "Milk", "Eggs"])
print(is_empty(trolley)) # False
```

---

Python is already duck-typed, so couldn't we just have left out type annotations and still run the program as normal?

(Yes üò¨)

---

## **Is it worth all the effort?**

* To really take advantages of type hints, we need to use a **static type checker**
* We incoporate type checkers into our workflow and flag when type checking fails
* We try to convert runtime errors into pre-runtime errors from the type checker

---

## **Mypy to the rescue**

* Most popular static type checker for Python
* CLI support and IDE integration (e.g., VS Code, IntelliJ IDEs)
* Active contributors include Guido van Rossum
* Installed like any Python package (`pip`, `poetry`, `conda` etc.)

---

## **How does it work?**

```python
# my_module.py
from typing import Protocol


class Sizeable(Protocol):

    def size(self) -> int:
        ...


def is_empty(container: Sizeable) -> bool:
    return container.size() == 0


my_list = [1, 2, 3]
print(is_empty(my_list))
```

---

Without a type checker, we only find out about errors in our code when we run it:

![GIF of a runtime error](./assets/runtime_error.gif)

---

With a type checker like Mypy, we flag the type error before ever running the code:

![GIF of a Mypy type error](./assets/type_checker_error.gif)

---

## **We can get real-time feedback in our IDE**

---

## **Mypy is configurable**

---

## **Bring your CI pipeline closer to home with pre-commit**

---

## **Give your data structure with data classes**

* Avoid passing data around as naked Python objects
* Provide a schema without the need for verbose class syntax

---

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass


@dataclass
class Person:
    name: str
    age: int
    occupation: str
    hobbies: list[str]

external_data = {
    "name": "Jamie",
    "age": 29,
    "occupation": "Data Engineer",
    "hobbies": ["Python", "Python", "More Python"]
}

jamie = Person(**external_data)
```

---

Without data classes, things don't look anywhere near as pretty ü§Æ

```python
class Person:
    def __init__(
        self,
        name: str,
        age: int,
        occupation: str,
        hobbies: list[str],
    ) -> None:
        self.name = name
        self.age = age
        self.occupation = occupation
        self.hobbies = hobbies
```

---

## **Data classes come with lots of nice features...**

* Data classes are much cleaner and more readable.
* We can define methods on data classes like we would with a normal class.
* We get boring methods like `__init__`, `__repr__`, `__eq__`, `__ne__` etc. for free.
* We can use `@datclass(frozen=True)` to make instances immutable.
* Functions like `dataclasses.asdict` can convert the data class back to a `dict`.

---

## **...but they're also deceptive**

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass


@dataclass
class UnvalidatedClass:
    string: str
    integer: int


data = {
    "string": 100,
    "integer: "100",
}

# Instantiates without issue ‚ö†Ô∏è
unvalidated_class = UnvalidatedClass(**data)
```

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **PSA** ‚ö†Ô∏è

* Data class inputs aren't validated for type.
* We can pass anything we want as the arguments to the class.
* We can use magic methods like `__post_init__` to validate inputs, but that's ugly!

---

## **Consider `pydantic` data classes**

* Like normal data classes on steroids
* Can validate inputs based on type

```python
from pydantic.dataclasses import dataclass


@dataclass
class ValidatedClass:
    string: str
    integer: int


# ValidationError: 1 validation error for ValidatedClass
# Input should be a valid string [type=string_type, input_value=100, input_type=int]
validated_class = ValidatedClass(string=100, integer="100")

```

---

## **As always, it's about tradeoffs**

* Richer functionality for data parsing and serialization with `pydantic`
* Yet another external dependency in a project
* Much less light-weight than `dataclasses.dataclass`
