# **Modern Python** üêç

<!-- Thanks everyone for joining the second Python Community talk today. -->
<!-- I'm Jamie, I'm a data engineer in the Data & AI practice -->
<!-- I'm going to talk today about what I'm loosely calling "Modern Python" and hopefully you'll see what I mean by that as I go on. -->

---

## **What's wrong with how I write Python now?**

Nothing (necessarily)

<!-- Before we get into anything, let's answer a first question: what's wrong with the Python you're writing now? -->
<!-- I don't know what kind of Python you write but I'd argue there's probably nothing wrong with it. -->

---

## **New isn't always better**

* Just because I like it doesn't mean you have to
* Take what you like, and leave what you don't

<!-- One of the important things to say at the top is that I'm going to talk about some newer features of Python, but
just because a feature is new doesn't mean it's better. -->
<!-- On top of that, just because I like a feature doesn't necessarily mean you will as well. -->
<!-- There's nothing cut and dry here, it's my opinion that writing in the style I'll show you is better, but that
doesn't make it true. -->
<!-- My advice would be, if there's anything I talk about today that you like, then adopt it in your code. -->
<!-- If there are things I talk about that you don't like, then don't adopt those things. -->
<!-- With that said, let's start with what is, hands-down, my favourite Python feature... -->

---

## ‚ú® **Type hints** ‚ú®

From this:

```python
def shout(word):
    print(f"{str.upper(word)}!")
```

To this:

```python
def shout(word: str) -> None:
    print(f"{str.upper(word)}!")
```

<!-- So what do type hints do? -->
<!-- I've got two blocks of code here which each define the same function "shout". -->
<!-- "shout" takes in a string and then uppercases that string and prints it to the console. -->
<!-- In the first block, I've got shout written with a traditional Python syntax -->
<!-- In the second block, I've got shout written using "type annotations" or "type hints" -->
<!-- Hopefully it's clear that all type hints do here is that they provide an explicit defintiion of expected type of the functions inputs along with the expected type of its output. -->
<!-- So here I specify that "word" is of type string, and I use the built-in Python string class to do that, and since all I do is print to the console, my function implicitly returns None, so then I use this arrow syntax and give a type hint to say that my function returns None. -->
<!-- And in its simplest form, that's what type annotations look like in Python -->
---

## **Why would I want to use type hints?**

>Type hints help us **document our code more easily** and **catch errors early**.

<!-- So why are these type annotations something that you'd be ineterested in using? -->
<!-- To me there are two main benefits to using type hints. -->
<!-- The first I think is already evident in that simple example which is that using type hints lets us document our code more easily. By defining the inputs and outputs of our functions explcitly we make it much easier for the people reading and using our code to understand it. -->
<!-- The second is that using type hints lets us catch errors earlier than we otherwise would, and we'll talk in some more depth about that a bit later. -->

---

## **But isn't Python dynamically typed?** ü§î

‚ö†Ô∏è Type hints are **aesthetic**, they don't actually enforce anything in our code. ‚ö†Ô∏è

```python
def say_hello(name: str) -> None:
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")


# Prints 'Hello, 100!'
say_hello(100)
```

<!-- One thing you might already be thinking is, wait, isn't Python a dynamically typed language? -->
<!-- Yes, Python is and presumably will always be a dynamically typed language. -->
<!-- One of the most important things to emphasise at this point is that type hints are purely aesthetic - they have absolutely no impact on the running of your code. -->
<!-- Python couldn't care less what type annotations you use, as long as at runtime it can run your code without errors -->
<!-- So as an example here I've got this "say_hello" function which just prints an interpolated string to the console using the name we pass in. -->
<!-- If we call that function with 100, an integer, as the argument, Python will still run that function just fine because it knows how to coerce an integer to a string. -->
<!-- Again, the interpreter doesn't respect or know anything about type annotations we use. -->

---

## **Subtyping**

Lots of classes in Python have a natural concept of a *subtype*, e.g., a collection of type A contains elements of type B.

```python
list[str]
tuple[int, int]
tuple[int, ...]
dict[str, str | None]  # dict[str, Optional[str]]
dict[str, int | float]  # dict[str, Union[int, float]]
```

<!-- A lot of the time we work with classes where it natually makes sense to think of one class being made of up of elements of another class. -->
<!-- So I've said here that this is the idea of something like a collection of type A being made up of elements of type B. -->
<!-- This is what we mean when we talk about subtypes. -->
<!-- I have a bunch of simple examples here and in Python we specify subtypes by using this square bracket notation. -->

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **PSA - lowercase vs. uppercase type hints** ‚ö†Ô∏è

```python
from typing Dict, List, Tuple


foo = List[int]
bar = list[int]

baz = Tuple[float, float]
qux = tuple[float, float]

spam = Dict[str, str]
ham = dict[str, str]
```

Built-ins are preferred, e.g., `list`, `dict`.

<!-- When you're using type hints in the wild you'll see them written in two slightly different ways. -->
<!-- Sometimes people will use upper-case variants of classes, and these are imported from the typing module. So things like uppercase List and uppercase Tuple. -->
<!-- Other times people will use the existing built-in, lowercase versions of those classes. -->
<!-- Both are equivalent and actually now the uppercase variants are just alises to the lowercase variants. -->
<!-- The reason both exist is that when type hints were first introducted, the built-in classes didn't support being used in type hints, whereas now they do have support. -->
<!-- At some point far in the future the uppercase variants will be deprecated so if you can, it's best to use the lowercase built-ins. -->

---

## **Type aliases**

```python
Point = tuple[float, float]

def scale(point: Point, factor: float) -> Point:
    return (factor * point[0], factor * point[1])


UserId = str

def delete_users(users: list[UserId]) -> None:
    for user in users:
        # Some logic here
```

<!-- Type aliases are a nice way to try and convey more meaning from a type hint. -->
<!-- So here I've defined a "Point" and Point is just a type alias for a tuple of two floats. -->
<!-- Even though Point isn't a class, I can now use it like one in my type hints. -->
<!-- I've then got this "scale" function which takes a point and a factor and it just multiplies each element of the point by the factor and returns the resulting point, which is just a tuple. -->
<!-- I've got another example here where I alias a string as a UserId, and then I use that in my function and sub-type list, so my function takes a list of user IDs and then does some processing of them. -->
<!-- I don't think type aliase are ground-breaking at all but they can be useful occasionally like I said as a way to impart a bit more meaning or context to your type hints. -->

---

## **We can type-hint functions too**

```python
from typing import Callable

# Callable[[int, int], int]
def add(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    return a + b


def apply(func: Callable[[Any], Any], values: Sequence[Any]) -> list[Any]:
    return [func(value) for value in values]

values = (1, 2, 3)
double = lambda x: 2 * x
applied_values = apply(double, values)  # [2, 4, 6]
```
<!-- We've seen how to type hint simple variables or collections like lists or dictionaries, but we can also type hint more complex things like functions. -->
<!-- When we type hint a function we use this Callable which we import from the typing module. -->
<!-- We sub-type Callable and provide a list of input types and then the return type for the function and you can see that in the first example where our function takes two integers as inputs and returns an integer as its output. -->
<!-- In the second example I have an "apply" function which takes some arbitrary function and some sequence of values, then it applies the function to each value in the sequence and returns the applied values in a list and you can see that it's just doing this using a list comprehension. -->
<!-- So for my type hints I've used Callable and Sequence, and because I want my "apply" function to be generic and I don't know upfront the types that will be used, I've just subtyped Callable and Sequence as "Any" so that I can pass any single-paramater fuction and any sequence of values into the function. -->

---

## **Avoid `Any` wherever you can**

* We should use `Any` like as a last resort
* Objects annotated with `Any` **do not** get type checked
* We can leave `Any` out and it will be inferred by a type checker

    ```python
    from typing import Callable, Sequence


    def apply(func: Callable, values: Sequence) -> list:
        return [func(value) for value in values]
    ```

<!-- I said the reason I was using Any was because I wanted my function to be generic, but actually using Any is the wrong way to do that. -->
<!-- Using Any doesn't make our type hints generic, it makes them overly-permissive and poorly scoped. -->
<!-- Let's look at the right way to make our functions generic. -->
---

## **Typed generics**

```python
from typing import Callable, Sequence, TypeVar


T = TypeVar("T")
U = TypeVar("U")


def apply(func: Callable[[T], U], values: Sequence[T]) -> list[U]:
    return [func(value) for value in values]


# Valid to a type checker ‚úÖ
numbers: tuple[int, int, int] = (1, 2, 3)
double: Callable[[int], int] = lambda x: x * 2
doubled = apply(double, numbers)

# Invalid to a type checker ‚ùå
words: list[str] = ["one", "two", "three"]
square: Callable[[int], int] = lambda x: x ** 2
squared = apply(square, words)
```

<!-- The right way to make type hints generic is to use something called typed generics. -->
<!-- We do this by importing TypeVar from the typing module and then defining two generic types, T and U, which represent some unknown future types. -->
<!-- The benefit of doing this is that I can keep my functions flexible but also embed the right relationships between the different types in the function signature. -->
<!-- If we look at the "apply" function, the func arg is a function which takes a value of type T and returns a value of type U, so then if the fucntion takes values of type T, then my sequence should also contain values of type T because I apply the funtion to each element of sequence. -->
<!-- Then because the function I pass to apply returns a value of type U, the resulting list should be a list of values of type U. -->
<!-- Now the "apply" function can be properly type checked. -->

---

## **What exactly is a `Sequence`?**

* Originates in `collections.abc` (`typing.Sequence` is an alias)
* `collections.abc` defines useful interfaces for general Python data collections
* The `Sequence` interface has two abstract methods: `__getitem__` and `__len__`
* Classes like `list`, `tuple` and `str` are *"virtual subclasses"* of `Sequence`

    ```python
    from typing import Sequence


    issubclass(list, Sequence)  # True
    issubclass(tuple, Sequence)  # True
    issubclass(str, Sequence)  # True
    ```

<!-- I've been banding around the idea of a sequence but actually if you haven't used typing in Python then you might not be familiar with sequences, so what are they? -->

---

## **General in ‚Üí specific out**

> If functions or methods only need their inputs to have generic behaviours (e.g., the ability to be sequenced or iterated over), then consider using more generic data structures like `Sequence` in type annotations to maintain flexibility - we sometimes call this using generic type bounds, and interfaces are a great way to define generic type bounds.

---

## **Interfaces - ABCs or Protocols?**

* Languages like Java make a distinction between *interfaces* and *abstract classes*
* In Python, we talk about interfaces and abstract classes interchangeably
* When we talk about an interface, we're really just thinking of a *blueprint*
* We can define an interface using either an abstract base class or a Protocol
* Which one we opt for depends on the typing style we use

---

## **Nominal vs. structural typing**

Nominal ‚Üí compatibility determined from declared type - ***"is it?"***
Structural ‚Üí compatibility determined from structure - ***"does it?"***

---

## **Using abstract base classes fits a nominal typing style**

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod


class Sizeable(ABC):

    @abstractmethod
    def size(self) -> int:
        ...
```

<!-- I've got an example here where I define an abstract base class for something I've called a Sizeable, which is just an object with a "size" method. -->
<!-- To do define the Sizeable class as abstract base class, we inherit from ABC and define the interface's methods using the "abstractmethod" decorator. -->

---

To use an ABC, we have to explicitly inherit from the parent class.

```python
class Trolley(Sizeable):
    def __init__(self, items: list[str]) -> None:
        self.items = items

    def size(self) -> int:
        return len(self.items)

    def add_item(item: str) -> None:
        self.items = [*self.items, item]


def is_empty(container: Sizeable) -> bool:
    return container.size() == 0


trolley = Trolley(["Bread", "Milk", "Eggs"])
print(is_empty(trolley))  # False

```

<!-- When it comes to using that interface, we have to explicitly inherit from Sizeable, again this is a nominal style. -->
<!-- I've got a Trolley which inherits from Sizeable and which implements the "size" method as well as an extra method to add an item to the trolley. -->
<!-- I've then got this module-level function which expects receive a Sizeable as its input, and then returns either True or False depending on whether the result of calling the Sizeable's "size" method is zero. -->
<!-- So I create a trolley with three items and call my "is_empty" function and it returns False like we'd expect. -->
<!-- So that's the abstract base class appraoch, let's see how things change with Protocols. -->

---

## **Using Protocols fits a structrual style**

```python
from typing import Protocol


class Sizeable(Protocol):

    def size(self) -> int:
        ...
```

<!-- Protocols let us define interfaces just like abstract base classes, but they enable us to use static duck-typing. -->
<!-- In this version I'm still defining the Sizeable interface, but I'm inheriting from Protocol instead of ABC, and I don't need to use that abstractmethod decorator on the "size" method. -->

---

```python
class Trolley:  # No need to inherit from Sizeable
    def __init__(self, items: list[str]) -> None:
        self.items = items

    def size(self) -> int:
        return len(self.items)

    def add_item(item: str) -> None:
        self.items = [*self.items, item]


def is_empty(container: Sizeable) -> bool:
    return container.size() == 0


trolley = Trolley(["Bread", "Milk", "Eggs"])
print(is_empty(trolley))  # False
```

<!-- Everything is essentially as it was before, the only difference is that now I haven't inherited from Sizeable when I defined the Trolley class. -->
<!-- So I can run this and it will work as expected. -->

---

> Python is already duck-typed, so without type annotations, wouldn't this already work without using ABCs *or* Proctocols?

---

## **Is it worth all the effort?**

* To really take advantages of type hints, we need to use a **static type checker**
* We incoporate type checkers into our workflow and flag when type checking fails
* We try to convert runtime errors into pre-runtime errors from the type checker

---

## **Mypy to the rescue** ü¶∏‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

* Most popular static type checker for Python
* CLI support and IDE integration (e.g., VS Code, IntelliJ IDEs)
* Active contributors include Guido van Rossum
* Installed like any Python package (`pip`, `poetry`, `conda` etc.)

---

## **What does it do?**

```python
# my_module.py
from typing import Protocol


class Sizeable(Protocol):

    def size(self) -> int:
        ...


def is_empty(container: Sizeable) -> bool:
    return container.size() == 0


my_list = [1, 2, 3]
print(is_empty(my_list))
```

<!-- We've got a simplified version of our example from before where we've defined a Protocol called Sizeable. -->
<!-- We're then passing a normal Python list to the "is_empty" function. -->
<!-- So what do we expect to happen? -->

---

Without a type checker, we only find out about errors in our code when we run it:

```shell
$ python my_module.py
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "my_module.py", line 16, in <module>
    print(is_empty(my_list))
          ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  File "my_module.py", line 12, in is_empty
    return container.size() == 0
           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
AttributeError: 'list' object has no attribute 'size'
```

<!-- Here, we run the code as usual and we get a runtime error. -->
<!-- As we'd expect, Python complains because lists don't have a "size" method. -->
<!-- The point is that this is a runtime error. -->

---

With a type checker like Mypy, we flag the type error before ever running the code:

```shell
$ mypy my_module.py
my_module.py:16: error: Argument 1 to "is_empty" has incompatible type "List[int]"; expected "Sizeable"
Found 1 error in 1 file (checked 1 source file)
```

<!-- Here, rather than running the code, we analyse it with Mypy. -->
<!-- We now get a similar error, but it's an error in the context of mis-matched types. -->

---

## **What's the big deal?**

* We found an error in our code without actually running it
* We turned what *would've* been a runtime error into a pre-runtime error
* Imagine an ML workflow failing after 10 hours because you mis-typed a method name
* With Mypy - and by making the effort to use type hints - we catch these errors early

---

## **Wait...so ABC or Protocol?**

* There's no "correct" choice
* Protocols are more flexible and mirror the classic duck-typed Python style
* In general, I prefer Protocols

<!-- That's everything I wanted to say about type hints, but there are a couple of other nice tools that I think go well with this idea of "Modern Python". -->

---

## **Consistently format your code**

* Poor formatting makes reading code and spotting mistakes hard
* We can use a code formatter like **Black** to enforce consistent formatting in our projects
* Installed with `pip`, `poetry`, `conda` etc.
* IDE plug-ins available

---

## **How does it work?**

```bash
$ black my_module.py
reformatted my_module.py

All done! ‚ú® üç∞ ‚ú®
1 file reformatted.
```

---

```python
# In
my_long_list = ["first", "second", "third", "fourth", "fifth", "sixth", "seventh", "eigth", "ninth", "tenth"]

# Out
my_long_list = [
    "first",
    "second",
    "third",
    "fourth",
    "fifth",
    "sixth",
    "seventh",
    "eigth",
    "ninth",
    "tenth",
]
```

---

```python
# In
result = Client().do_this()\
    .then_do_this()\
    .then_this()\
    .and_finally_this()

# Out
result = (
    Client().do_this()
    .then_do_this()
    .then_this()
    .and_finally_this()
)
```

---

## **Black is *opinionated***

Actually, Black is *very* opinionated:

* Sometimes you won't like how if formats your code
* Sometimes you'll like how it formats your code and another person in your team won't

    ```python
    # True ‚úÖ
    no_one_fully_happy + consistent == everyone_happy
    ```

    (but if you're *really* unhappy, it's configurable)

---

## **Stop manually sorting your imports**

* Sort your imports with Isort
* Installed like Black - `pip`, `poetry`, `conda` etc.

    ```bash
    $ isort my_module.py
    Fixing my_module.py
    ```

---

```python
# In
from datetime import timezone, datetime, timedelta
import asyncio
from airflow.models.baseoperator import BaseOperator
import functools


# Out
import asyncio
import functools
from datetime import datetime, timedelta, timezone

from airflow.models.baseoperator import BaseOperator
```

---

## **When you run Isort it...**

* Splits imports into separate stdlib and non-stdlib import blocks
* Auto-sorts import blocks alphabetically
* Auto-sorts `import ...` and `from ... import ...`
* Even has native compability with Black:

    ```bash
    $ isort my_module.py --profile black
    Fixing my_module.py
    ```

---

## **Bring your CI pipeline closer to home with pre-commit**

* Pre-commit is a Python-based framework for managing Git hooks
* We can configure hooks to run everytime we commit (which should be often!)
* Pre-commit has a bank of pre-defined, easy-to-use hooks
* Hooks already exist for Black, Isort and Mypy!
* Easily installed with `pip`, `conda`, `brew` etc.

---

We configure our hooks with using a `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file:

```yaml
repos:
  -   repo: https://github.com/pre-commit/mirrors-mypy
      rev: v1.4.1
      hooks:

---

* Tons of existing hooks, including checks for:
  * Mixed line endings
  * Trailing whitespace
  * Validate terraform, run tflint etc.
  * Format YAML, JSON, TOML etc.
* Easy to define custom hooks, e.g., to run unit tests on commit
* Create a tighter feedback loop and bring your CI checks closer to you
* Support for other languages/frameworks like `node`, `dotnet`, `golang`, `rust`, `r`
